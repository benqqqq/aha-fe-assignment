## Context

- `create-react-app` is outdated, we need a new way to quickly start our project


## Decision

- Use https://github.com/wtchnm/Vitamin as our project template


## Consequences

- with this template, we have :
    - react : In this assignment, we have to use React as our framework
    - Vite, Vitest : is one the most popular tools to build front-end project for now
    - TypeScript : preferable versus JavaScript
    - Tailwindcss : a fast and clean way to build layout
    - ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged : configured settings, we don't need to do it by ourselves
    - pnpm : faster than traditional npm
